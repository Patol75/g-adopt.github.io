# Welcome to G-ADOPT

**G-ADOPT** is a computational platform for inverse geoscientific
modelling being developed and maintained by researchers from the
*Research School of Earth Sciences* at the *Australian National
University*. It builds on a recent surge in accessible observational
datasets and advances in inversion methods using sophisticated adjoint
techniques that provide a mechanism for fusing these observations with
dynamics, physics and chemistry.
